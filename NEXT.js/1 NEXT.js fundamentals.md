# Introduction
- NEXT.js is a framework for building super fast and search engine friendly applications which built on top of React.
- React is just a library for creating interactive UIs but NEXT.js is a comprehensive framework.
- Framework is a collection of libraries, tools and conventions that streamline application development.
- As an example NEXT.js include its own routing library. So we don't need to use a separate library like React Route.
- Using Next.js we can also do full stack development.
