4. **Run `/quality-check`** after completing notes
5. **Weekly use `/weekly-summary`** for progress tracking

## üìù Image Organization Guidelines

### Screenshot Naming Convention:
- `spring-framework-modules.png`
- `dependency-injection-diagram.png`
- `controller-structure.png`
- `jpa-relationships.png`
- `java-version-verification.png`
- `intellij-welcome-screen.png`

### When to Take Screenshots:
- Architecture diagrams
- Code structure examples
- IDE screenshots showing setup
- Error messages and solutions
- Configuration examples
- Terminal command outputs
- Download/installation pages

### Screenshot Placement Strategy:
- **Inline with content**: Place screenshots immediately after the concept they illustrate
- **After code blocks**: Show terminal outputs after command examples
- **During explanations**: Insert UI screenshots while describing interface elements
- **With bullet points**: Add relevant images right after explaining key concepts
- **NO separate sections**: Integrate all images contextually within main content

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Daily Routine:
1. Use `/prep-note` before video
2. Take screenshots during video
3. Use `/create-note` after video
4. Apply `/quality-check` before saving

### Weekly Review:
1. Use `/weekly-summary` for progress
2. Apply `/connect-concepts` for understanding
3. Run `/organize-files` for maintenance
