## Domain Model Overview

- **Database connection**: Bridge database schema with Java application
- **Object-relational mapping**: Convert database tables to Java objects
- **Application integration**: Enable Java code to work with database data
- **Foundation layer**: Essential for Spring Boot data access functionality

![Domain Model Connection Overview](assets/domain-model-connection-overview.png)

**Domain model purpose:**
- Represent database tables as Java classes
- Provide object-oriented interface to data
- Enable type-safe database operations
- Support business logic implementation

## Segment Learning Path

- **Progressive complexity**: Build from basic entities to complex relationships
- **Tool integration**: Introduce productivity tools gradually
- **Practical focus**: Hands-on implementation of real-world scenarios
- **Alternative approaches**: Explore different development methodologies

![Domain Model Learning Path](assets/domain-model-learning-path.png)

**Learning progression:**
- Basic entity creation and mapping
- Code optimization with modern tools
- Relationship implementation
- Advanced tooling and automation
- Alternative development approaches

## Topics Covered

### Entity Definition and Mapping

- **Entity fundamentals**: Understanding JPA entities and their role
- **Database mapping**: How Java classes correspond to database tables
- **Annotation usage**: Essential JPA annotations for entity definition
- **Field mapping**: Connecting Java fields to database columns

![Entity Definition and Mapping](assets/entity-definition-mapping-diagram.png)

**Core concepts:**
- @Entity annotation for class marking
- @Table annotation for table mapping
- @Column annotations for field mapping
- Primary key and ID generation strategies

### Code Simplification with Lombok

- **Boilerplate elimination**: Remove repetitive getter/setter code
- **Constructor generation**: Automatic constructor creation
- **Code readability**: Cleaner, more maintainable entity classes
- **Development efficiency**: Focus on business logic instead of boilerplate

![Lombok Code Simplification](assets/lombok-code-simplification-example.png)

**Lombok benefits:**
- Reduced code verbosity
- Automatic method generation
- Improved code maintainability
- Enhanced developer productivity

### Entity Relationships

- **Relationship types**: One-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one mappings
- **JPA annotations**: @OneToMany, @ManyToMany, @OneToOne configurations
- **Bidirectional relationships**: Managing relationships from both sides
- **Cascade operations**: Automatic related entity management

![Entity Relationships Overview](assets/entity-relationships-overview-diagram.png)

**Relationship implementations:**
- **One-to-Many**: User to Addresses relationship
- **Many-to-Many**: User to Tags relationship with join table
- **One-to-One**: User to Profile relationship
- **Foreign key management**: Proper constraint handling

### Development Tools Integration

- **JPA Buddy**: Productivity tool for entity and migration generation
- **Code generation**: Automatic entity creation from database schema
- **Migration assistance**: Simplified database migration creation
- **Development acceleration**: Faster implementation of common patterns

![JPA Buddy Tool Integration](assets/jpa-buddy-tool-integration.png)

**Tool advantages:**
- Visual entity design
- Automatic code generation
- Migration script creation
- IntelliJ IDE integration

### Model-First Approach

- **Alternative methodology**: Start with Java classes instead of database
- **Schema generation**: Create database tables from entity definitions
- **Workflow comparison**: Contrast with database-first approach
- **Use case scenarios**: When to choose model-first development

![Model-First Approach Workflow](assets/model-first-approach-workflow.png)

**Model-first benefits:**
- Object-oriented design focus
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Schema evolution through code
- Developer-friendly workflow

## Learning Objectives

**By the end of this segment, you will:**
- **Entity mastery**: Create and configure JPA entities with proper annotations
- **Lombok proficiency**: Use Lombok to eliminate boilerplate code effectively
- **Relationship expertise**: Implement all types of entity relationships correctly
- **Tool utilization**: Leverage JPA Buddy for faster development workflows
- **Approach flexibility**: Understand both database-first and model-first methodologies
- **Best practices**: Apply proper entity design patterns for maintainable code

![Learning Objectives Roadmap](assets/learning-objectives-roadmap-domain.png)

**Skill development areas:**
- JPA annotation usage
- Entity relationship mapping
- Code optimization techniques
