## Problems with Manual Dependency Management

- **Simple examples work**: Manual object creation works fine for basic scenarios
- **Complexity grows quickly**: As applications grow, manual dependency management becomes problematic
- **Nested dependencies**: What if PayPalPaymentService has its own dependencies?
- **Chain reactions**: Would need to create and wire more objects manually
- **Management issues**: Process becomes messy, tedious, and error-prone

**Example scenario**: PayPalPaymentService might depend on LoggingService, ConfigurationService, etc.

## Spring Framework Solution

- **Automatic object creation**: Spring creates objects automatically
- **Automatic dependency injection**: Framework handles wiring dependencies together
- **Core feature**: One of Spring's most important capabilities
- **Simplified development**: Reduces boilerplate code and complexity

## Understanding IoC Container

### What are Beans

- **Definition**: A bean is a regular Java object managed by Spring
- **Spring terminology**: Managed objects are called "beans"
- **No special requirements**: Just normal Java objects under Spring management
- **Container managed**: Spring handles their entire lifecycle

![Spring Beans Concept](assets/spring-beans-concept.png)

### Container Responsibilities

- **Object creation**: Spring creates bean instances
- **Dependency injection**: Automatically injects required dependencies
- **Lifecycle management**: Handles initialization and cleanup
- **Storage and retrieval**: Acts as a repository for application objects

## Inversion of Control (IoC) Explained

### Traditional Approach

- **Developer control**: We write code to create objects
- **Manual dependency management**: We handle all dependency wiring
- **Direct instantiation**: Use `new` keyword to create objects
- **Full responsibility**: Application code manages object lifecycle

### IoC Approach

- **Framework control**: Spring takes control of object creation
- **Automatic management**: Container handles dependency resolution
- **Inverted responsibility**: Control is handed over to the framework
- **Simplified code**: Less boilerplate, more focus on business logic

![Inversion of Control Comparison](assets/inversion-of-control-comparison.png)

**Key insight**: IoC "inverts" who has control over object creation and dependency management

## Using the IoC Container

### Getting Application Context

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class StoreApplication {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // SpringApplication.run returns ApplicationContext
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(StoreApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

![Getting Application Context](assets/getting-application-context.png)

**ApplicationContext details:**
- **Return type**: `SpringApplication.run()` returns ApplicationContext object
- **Package**: `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext`
- **Role**: Acts as the IoC container for the application
- **Storage**: Container for all managed objects (beans)

### Retrieving Beans

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(StoreApplication.class, args);
    
    // Get bean from IoC container
    OrderService orderService = context.getBean(OrderService.class);
    orderService.placeOrder();
}
```

![Retrieving Beans from Container](assets/retrieving-beans-from-container.png)

**getBean() method:**
- **Purpose**: Retrieve managed objects from IoC container
- **Parameter**: Pass class type (`OrderService.class`)
- **Return**: Returns instance of requested bean type
- **Automatic**: Spring handles all dependency injection

### Updated Implementation

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class StoreApplication {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(StoreApplication.class, args);
        
        // Let Spring create and manage objects
        OrderService orderService = context.getBean(OrderService.class);
        orderService.placeOrder();
        
        // Remove manual object creation - no longer needed
        // OrderService orderService = new OrderService();
        // orderService.setPaymentService(new PayPalPaymentService());
    }
}
```

![Updated IoC Container Implementation](assets/updated-ioc-container-implementation.png)

**Benefits of this approach:**
- **No manual creation**: Spring handles object instantiation
- **Automatic dependencies**: Framework injects required dependencies
- **Cleaner code**: Less boilerplate, more readable
- **Centralized management**: All objects managed in one place

## Running the Application

### The Exception

**Error type**: `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`
**Error message**: "No qualifying bean of type 'OrderService' available"

![NoSuchBeanDefinitionException Error](assets/nosuchbeandefinitionexception-error.png)

### Understanding the Error

- **Root cause**: Spring doesn't know how to create OrderService instance
- **Missing configuration**: No instructions provided to Spring about bean creation
- **Container limitation**: IoC container can only manage objects it knows about
- **Solution needed**: Must tell Spring how to create and manage OrderService

![Spring Bean Configuration Missing](assets/spring-bean-configuration-missing.png)

**Key insight**: Spring needs explicit instructions to know which classes to manage as beans

**Next steps**: Two ways to solve this issue (covered in upcoming lessons):
1. Component scanning with annotations
2. Java configuration classes

## Key Points

- **Main takeaway**: Spring IoC container automates object creation and dependency injection, eliminating manual dependency management complexity
- **When to use**: In all Spring applications where you want automatic dependency management
- **IoC definition**: Inversion of Control means handing over object creation control to the Spring framework
- **Beans concept**: Beans are regular Java objects managed by Spring container
- **ApplicationContext role**: Acts as the IoC container that stores and provides access to beans
- **Configuration requirement**: Spring needs to be told which classes to manage as beans
- **Error handling**: NoSuchBeanDefinitionException occurs when Spring doesn't know how to create requested beans
- **Benefits**: Reduces boilerplate code, handles complex dependency chains automatically, and centralizes object management
- **Next step**: Learn how to configure Spring to recognize and manage beans
