- If want to use bootstrap classes we only need to import it on `index.tsx`
```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```

- When we use bootstrap component first we need to install `bootstrap` and `react-bootstrap packages` and import relevant component before using it at the above of the page.
```js
import { Button, Container, Nav, Navbar as NavbarBs } from "react-bootstrap";
```
