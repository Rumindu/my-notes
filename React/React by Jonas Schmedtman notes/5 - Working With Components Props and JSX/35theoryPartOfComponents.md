* React renders a `view` for each components. And all these `view`s together build user interface.

* Each components contain **Data, Logic, Appearance**

* We build complex UIs by **building multiple components** and **combining** them
* Components can be **reused**, **nested** inside each other, and pass data between them.
* we use `props` to pass data to components.
* In below image we can see `question` component is **reusing** but data is different. so we use `props` to pass those data to the components.
