* According to the latest React native documentation **No need to install expo cli globally now**
* `npx create-expo-app myproject` // 'myproject' is project name
then
  `cd myproject`
  `npx expo start`

* react native doesn't inherit styles from parent's class like CSS. But `<Text><Text></Text></Text>` inner Text component inherit outer Text component styles.
