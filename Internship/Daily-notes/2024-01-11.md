## Mocking function-

- backend -> `edit.test.ts` line 29

```ts
(updateTodo as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue({
  message: "Successfully update",
});
```

- Here `update` function is inside the controller_todo.ts file. There is another function called `updateTodo`which is at service_todo.ts file, is been calling inside the `update` function
- To do a unit test on `update` function, we don't need to do a test on `update todo function`. Therefor we mock functions return. mocking part is done inthe above code segment.
