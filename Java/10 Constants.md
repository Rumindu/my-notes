- Once we can't change its value. In java key word for constant is `final`
- ex-
  ```java
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Convention for naming constants is use all capital letters
        final float PI = 3.14F;
        System.out.println(PI);
    }
  }
  ```
