# Variables.

- use for storage data temporary in memory.
- Declare and assign a value to a variable
  ```java
  //Code in the jshell
  int age = 30;
  //format
  //type identifier(name)=value
  
  //reassign value 
  age=40;
	
  ```
- Naming convention of variable is ***Camal case.***
- We can't use reserved key words for naming classes, variables and methods.
